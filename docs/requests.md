# Requests
- 2026-02-14 – deliver the `examples/mobile.html` sample page referenced by `docs/examples.md` to demonstrate the mobile UI (per AGENTS.md line 20).
- 2026-02-14 – add examples where some days contain up to three check-in/check-out pairs in `examples/mobile.html`.
- 2026-02-14 – keep the current approved version as a snapshot at `examples/snapshots/mobile-2026-02-14-v1.html` and use a dated snapshot workflow going forward.
- 2026-02-14 – create `examples/snapshots/mobile-2026-02-14-v2.html` from the current `examples/mobile.html` and treat it as the active color-preference baseline.
- 2026-02-14 – add a sample-only modal day editor preview to `examples/mobile.html` for visual testing (no persistence).
- 2026-02-14 – use `.day-row` itself as the edit trigger and remove `.edit-day-btn` from `examples/mobile.html`.
- 2026-02-14 – remove `div.editor-header` from the modal editor in `examples/mobile.html`.
- 2026-02-14 – remove the modal title element and close button from the editor UI in `examples/mobile.html`.
- 2026-02-14 – remove `span.pair-label` text from the modal pair editor UI in `examples/mobile.html`.
- 2026-02-14 – remove the pair-count limit: allow any number of check-in/check-out pairs and update the sample editor accordingly.
- 2026-02-14 – new design specs: hide days without time events and apply fixed break exclusion for covered `11:30` to `12:00` intervals.
- 2026-02-14 – implement real `timestamp.php` as a UI scaffold using `examples/mobile.html` patterns: modal day editor from `.day-row`, unlimited pair inputs, hidden empty days, and no `timestamp.db` usage yet.
- 2026-02-14 – implement SQLite initialization and usage in `timestamp.php`: create schema for `time_entries`, seed first-run sample rows, and render week/day view from `timestamp.db`.
- 2026-02-14 – implement real header check-in/check-out toggle in `timestamp.php`: POST action writes to `time_entries`, closes latest open row on check-out, and updates header title/button based on open state.
- 2026-02-14 – implement modal day-editor persistence in `timestamp.php`: save submitted pairs for selected date into `time_entries`, skip rows where both values are empty, and allow day deletion by clearing all rows.
- 2026-02-14 – implement compact time parsing in modal save flow: accept `HH:mm`, `745`, and `1712`-style inputs and normalize to `HH:mm` before storing.
- 2026-02-14 – implement client-side modal validation: highlight invalid row inputs, show inline error text, and block save submit until row formats/order are valid.
- 2026-02-14 – accepted new UX spec: show a tiny grey footer version stamp in `yyyy-mm-dd-HH-MM` format, sourced from `timestamp.php` last-modified timestamp.
- 2026-02-14 – mirror the new version-stamp UX in `examples/mobile.html` by adding a tiny grey footer stamp for visual reference.
- 2026-02-14 – implement the real footer version stamp in `timestamp.php` using `timestamp.php` file mtime formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd-HH-MM`.
- 2026-02-14 – accepted break-rule refinement: count break only when a pair fully covers `11:30` to `12:00`; partial overlap does not count.
- 2026-02-14 – implemented break-rule refinement in `timestamp.php`: break minutes now apply only when a pair fully contains `11:30`–`12:00`.
- 2026-02-14 – modal UX refinement: show a hint only when any valid row overlaps `11:30`–`12:00`, and clarify that break is counted only for full-window coverage.
