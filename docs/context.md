# Context
- Single-user timestamp tracker for mobile (1080×2340, DPR 3) that records check-ins/check-outs, displays up to eight weeks with totals, and stores timestamps in `timestamp.db`.
- Time is shown in 24-hour `HH:mm` format and Norway/Europe/Oslo timezone; authentication by `.htaccess` per `docs/design.md`.
- Example layout material is housed in `examples/mobile.html` so the mobile UI constraints from `docs/examples.md` can be referenced and previewed.
- Use `docs/requests.md` to capture any new specifications mentioned during chat and keep `docs/architecture.md` in sync with decisions.

## Prompt log
- 2026-02-14 – consolidated status: completed docs cleanup by splitting and compressing request history, implemented `tests/regression.sh` for toggle/save-day/parsing/break/hint checks, validated the script successfully, and closed the last open backlog item so `docs/todo.md` currently has no open tasks.
